Random Crashes: You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is run.
After running it ten times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place.
The application is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library.
What programming errors could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?

I would test to find what function or sequence is invoking the crash. This test is something that I would do to find a commonality.
Once you have this determined then you can proceed with fixing the error because even though the app
never crashes at the same place during usage, the application must be invoking similar code that is causing
crashes or the data being sent to functions while changing is invoking an error.
