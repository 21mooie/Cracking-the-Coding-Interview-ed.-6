Chess Test: We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo( int x, int y).
ThismethodispartofthePieeeclassandreturnswhetherornotthepiececanmoveto position (x, y).
Explain how you would test this method.

You can test this by initiating chess pieces and giving them positions and seeing if the returned boolean
matches what should be the case based from the piece type and its current location.
For example, you can start with standard tests like if a pawn can move one space forward and confirming it
cannot move backwards. Then you can test special scenarios like when there are other pieces on the board.
Pawns can only move diagonally when there is a piece there to be taken so this should be tested.
Things of this scenario should be tested. Also if another of your pieces are at the position
you would like to move to, then you won't be able to move there. One test you need to do as well is any
moves which would put you into check. The rules of chess disallow that so this would require the piece
to have knowledge about any impending checks that could result from a move. Last one edge case should be to
confirm that you can't move to a position you are currently at. This isn't valid in chess.
