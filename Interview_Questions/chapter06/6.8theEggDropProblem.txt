The Egg Drop Problem: There is a building of 100 floors.
If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break.
If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs.
Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

This is a dynamic programming problem. You must balance the question for 
the worst case. x+(x-1)+(x-2)....+1 = 100. This means x is about 13.95. Through logic we can see going up by 14, then 13, then 12, is the easiest and quickest way to get the number of steps we want.c
