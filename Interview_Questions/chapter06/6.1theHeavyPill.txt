The Heavy Pill: You have 20 bottles of pills.
19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
You can only use the scale once.


So you number the bottles based on the way they are given to you.
Take one pill from bottle 1, two pills from bottle 2, three pills from bottle 3 and so forth.
Based on which bottle has the 1.1 pills the total weight will be different as there were a different number of pills weighted to get there.
