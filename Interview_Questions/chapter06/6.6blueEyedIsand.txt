Blue-Eyed Island: A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order:
all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible.
There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening.
Each person can see everyone else's eye color,
but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them).
Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes,
although they do know that at least one person does.
How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

It will take n days where n is the number of people with blue eyes. If there is only one person with blue eyes they would leave after realizing no one else has blue eyes. If there are two they would see on the second day that the person they see with blue eyes did not leave so that must mean they see someone with blue eyes and thus they will leave on the second day.
This continues as for the number of people there are.
