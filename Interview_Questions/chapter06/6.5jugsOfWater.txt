You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups)_How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped,
such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible_

Fill the three quart jug.
Pour into the 5 quart jug.
2 quarts left in 5 quart jug.
Fill the three quart jug.
Pour into the 5 quart jug.
1 quart left in 3 quart jug.
