Ants on a Triangle: There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle.
What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?
Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen,
and that they walk at the same speed.

P ( c o l l i s i o n ) = 1 - P (same d i r e c t i o n ) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

For n vertices
P(collision) = 1- P(same direction) = 1 -  (.5)^n-1
