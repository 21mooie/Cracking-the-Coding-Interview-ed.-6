Personal Financial Manager: Explain how you would design a personal financial manager (like Mint.com).
This system would connect to your bank accounts, analyze your spending habits, and make recommendations.

To start, you need to define which banks will be accommodated. These banks will have different apis that you will need to implement in order
to talk to them and get the bank account information you are interested in. Once this is set up properly, the bank account information
should be run through an AI that determines classifications on what kind of spending this user does. When they spend, what they spend their money on,
how frivolous it is, if it puts their bank account in jeapordy, how it tracks compared to their income, etc.
This AI will determine these classifications and come up with different recommendations based on this information.
Based on these recommendations, we would give the user different advice.
